threads::tbb version 0.03
=========================

This is a very early alpha wrapper for the Intel Threading Building
BlocksÂ® C++ library for Perl 5.  It hopes to add data parallelism and
easy-to-use pipelining API to Perl 5.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make -j
   make test
   make install

See the installed perldoc for L<threads::tbb> for information on how
to use the library.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires the TBB library be installed and system headers
in the appropriate place.  For debian/ubuntu users, you will need the
"libtbb-dev" package.  Instructions for other distributions and
operating systems will hopefully end up here eventually!
